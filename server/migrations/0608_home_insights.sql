-- 0608: more on the restaurant Home (founder, 27 Oct 2026): what the day's data already says, in one read. Read only. Safe to run again.
--   * mix:      today's orders by how they were served (dine in, takeaway, delivery), with sales and the average bill
--   * payments: today's money by method (cash, card, UPI, …)
--   * top:      today's five best-selling dishes, by quantity, with what they brought in
--   * menu:     how the menu stands: dishes with few left to make (from 0605's "can be made"), out of stock, average food cost and the dishes
--               over 45% (the Recipe tab's own figure, mb_recipe_json), and dishes missing a recipe, photo or description
--   * ready:    dishes the kitchen has made that are waiting to be served
-- "Today" is the store's day (its time zone). Cancelled orders and lines are left out.
